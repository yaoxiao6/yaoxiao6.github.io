                    <p>Kaggle is a data science community involved with innumerable datasets for machine learning, a
                        forum for data scientists, and competition about data science.
                        The competition aims to solve complex real-world problems with the skill of data science and
                        award the winners with great bonus.
                        To participate in this competition, I begin my data science learning with the online course
                        "Machine Learning" taught by Prof. Andrew Ng. I studied important algorithms, such as neural
                        network and unsupervised learning. The solid math background ensures my progress of future
                        project. However, that is not enough. I then learned practical coding skills on the learning
                        part of Kaggle's forum website. I have acquired skills to manage dataset with SQL, clean data
                        with python, and visualize data with Seaborn. Nowadays, I am working on a project about
                        <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/competitive-data-science-predict-future-sales"
                            target="_blank">predicting future sales</a>. I am currently on the step of changing
                        parameters to fit my model.

                    <p> I aim to be a full stack developer who acquire both front-end and back-end skills. This personal
                        website is the milestone marking my achievement of the front-end learning. At the beginning, I
                        knew nothing about front-end development. I started learning from HTML, then CSS and JavaScript,
                        on my own by practicing on
                        <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/" target="_blank">freecodecamp</a>.
                        Not satisfied by basic skills, I took CS103 course at BU to learn more about web programming,
                        like promoting my website with search engines or improving accessibility for different-abled
                        users. At the end, I employed those skills into my personal blog website, which is the website
                        you are viewing now. It introduces me by exhibiting my internship, education, experiences, and
                        personal interest on pages.

                    <p> I was the research assistant of Professor Hu Shengde at Wuhan University of Science and
                        Technology. Our project aimed to improve the quality of steel by removing the residual stress
                        that usually makes steel more fragile. We employed the electrolytic polishing method to clean
                        the steel’s surface, measured the steel’s stress by X-ray, and annealed the steel to finally
                        eliminate the residual stress. We also experimented with several other methods to eliminate
                        stress and found the most effective and economical one. A paper was published at <a

                    <p>My friend and I built a mobile APP for students to reserve food and seat for their lunch at
                        surrounding restaurants. We built a win-win situation between customers and restaurant.
                        With our platform, students can get their food ready when they arrived
                        the restaurant and save the time of waiting for cooking. Moreover, the restaurant can cut their
                        cost by estimating food ingredient needed according to pre-ordered bills. Also, we made a
                        little profit by setting price difference. Overall, there are 234 daily active
                        users on average and we earned 2000 RMB at the end.</p>

                    <p> When I was learning Python, I set a goal for myself: writing a little game, the greedy snake, in
                        Python. It was not easy for me. Although I know the logic in this game well, I struggled through
                        making a graphical user interface. After checking several blogs, I employed the PyGame library
                        to deal with GUI. However, there were a new problem. The panel was blank without snake and food.
                        This problem bothered me for a long time. Finally, I found out that I accidentally set snake
                        outside of the panel with the help from peers and professors. The accomplished version is
