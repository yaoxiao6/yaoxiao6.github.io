                    <p> Ultimate frisbee is one of the training sports in my high school. As the co-founder of class
                        frisbee team, I designed training program and promoted our team on social medias.
                        To learn more tactics, I kept watching and analyzing the competitions from American Ultimate
                        Disc League. My favorite team, Los Angeles Aviators, taught me a lot about skills, strategies
                        and spirits in this game.
                        Finally, I brought our team into Chinese college-level frisbee tournament.
                        Even without professional training, we ended up as the second place among 16 teams in 2019.</p>

                    <p> Once I got a camera as my birthday present, I started to record the good moment in my life. By
                        freezing the memorable time, I can share my happiness with my friends or review these moments in
                        the future. Taking pictures with camera is more complicated but more interesting than shooting
                        with phones. With the help of internet, I learned lots of knowledge about aperture, shutter
                        speed, ISO, focal length, composition, retouching, and so on from various photographers. To
                        practice these theorical knowledge, I took thousands of photos with my own camera on each trip
                        or just in daily life. I have posted some of them on my online gallery.
